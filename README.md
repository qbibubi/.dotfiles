## Installation

**WARNING:** This repository is in unfinished state and scripts might not work properly (or at all). In case you want to give these dotfiles a try you should fork the repository, review the code and tailor it to your needs. Blindly copying my settings can result in undefined behavior. Use at your own risk.
